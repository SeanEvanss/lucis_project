This was my first major python project (circa 2015), that I'm now uploading to Github. It's a 2D RPG game made primarily with the PyGame library with the assets themselves being created by my team and I. 
The project was never 100% complete so here is more a vertical slice of what has been done thus far. 

I might continue this project after revamping the code base in the future.
